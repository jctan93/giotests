                   Total Phase Beagle Sample Code
                   ------------------------------

Contents
--------
c/       - Examples using C/C++ API
python/  - Python script examples
csharp/  - C# examples
vb.net/  - Visual Basic .NET examples (Windows only)
vb6/     - Visual Basic 6 examples (32-bit Windows only)


Instructions
------------
Each individual examples directory has a README.txt which generally
describes how to run the examples given.  Please see those files for
more details.

Every example is relatively short and well-commented.  The
application developer is referred to the source code of the examples
for detailed information on how each example operates.

The C, Python, and C# examples include all of the following modules,
while only a subset of these modules are demonstrated in the other
language directories.


API Features
------------
For a detailed explanation of the API features and constructs, please
refer to the Beagle datasheet.  For a quick overview on the
differences in API syntax between languages, refer to the README.txt
found in the Beagle Software API package containing the Rosetta Language
Bindings.  The Beagle datasheet and Software API package are available on
the Total Phase website.
