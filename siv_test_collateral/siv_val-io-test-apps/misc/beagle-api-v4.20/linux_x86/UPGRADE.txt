                  Beagle Protocol Analyzer Software
                  ---------------------------------

Introduction
------------
This document outlines the changes required to upgrade existing
software that is dependent on previous versions of the API.  Only
the changes between versions are given in the sections below.  New
features are addressed in the datasheet.

Please ensure that all older copies of the Beagle library
(beagle.dll or beagle.so) are removed from your operating system
path before running your upgraded application.  This will help
prevent the wrong library from being loaded with your application,
thereby causing a version mismatch.


Upgrade from v1.xx to v2.00
---------------------------
- On Microsoft Windows platforms, ensure that the USB driver
  has been upgraded to version 1.1.0.0.  See the Beagle datasheet
  for details.

- Changes to naming convention of certain types.  For example,
  BEAGLE_STATUS is now BeagleStatus.

- Constants now have the prefix "BG_" as opposed to "BEAGLE_".

- Function names now have the prefix "bg_" as opposed to "beagle_".

- Changed the function prototype for all read functions with timing
  (e.g., bg_spi_read_bit_timing) to include a length argument in
  front of every array passed into the function, including
  data buffers and timing buffers.


Upgrade from v2.xx to v3.01
---------------------------
- Changed old "bg_usb_" prefix to "bg_usb12_" to better differentiate
  the older functions with the newer "bg_usb480_" prefixed functions.

- Added an "events" argument to the bg_usb12_read functions that is
  filled with bus events that are seen on the bus.  This better segments
  status codes from bus events.  The various bus event constants have
  been renamed from their previous "BG_STATUS_" prefix to "BG_EVENT_".

- Changed Rosetta bindings for C#, .NET, VB.NET, and VB6 such that all
  arrays must be also accompanied by a separate length argument.  See
  the README.txt for details.

- Changed Rosetta bindings for C# to fix type specification for output
  arrays (arrays that are filled by the API function).  These arrays no
  longer need to be passed as "ref array_var_name".

- Changed bg_find_devices_ext function so that each array argument
  (devices and unique_ids) is preceded by its own individual length
  specification.  Please see Beagle datasheet for the behavior
  when these lengths are not equal.

- Replaced bg_buffers_avail and bg_buffers_info functions with
  bg_host_buffer_size, bg_host_buffer_free, and bg_host_buffer_used.
  See the Beagle datasheet for details on these new functions.

- A new event code, BG_USB_TARGET_RESET, has been added and the
  bg_usb12_read functions now return it along with the
  BG_EVENT_TARGET_DISCONNECT event.  Previously there was only
  a single BG_READ_USB_TARGET_DISCONNECT constant.

- Changed BG_USB_PID_RESERVE constant to BG_USB_PID_RESERVED.


Upgrade from v3.01 to v3.02
---------------------------
- Support for Python v2.3 has been deprecated.  Due to certain
  issues with integer types in Python 2.3, large unsigned 32-bit
  integers returned from the API will appear as signed negative
  integers.  Total Phase recommends upgrading to Python 2.4 or
  greater since it is possible that support for Python 2.3 may be
  entirely dropped in the future.

Upgrade from v3.xx to v4.00
---------------------------
- Renamed certain BG_USB480_* constant and enum prefixes to BG_USB2_*
  to enable sharing between the Beagle USB 480 and the Beagle
  USB 5000.

Upgrade from v4.00 to v4.10
---------------------------
- Changed method for marking CRCs on match units to use the
  BeagleUsb5000ErrorType enum.
- BG_USB5000_SIMPLE_MATCH_IMMEDIATE changed to
  BG_USB5000_SIMPLE_MATCH_NONE.

Upgrade from v4.10 to v4.20
---------------------------
- Changed names for many USB 3 related constants and types.  In each
  case BG_USB5000_* was changed to BG_USB5000_USB3_*, and
  BeagleUsb5000* was changed to BeagleUsb5000Usb3*.  The following
  names were changed:

  * BG_USB5000_SIMPLE_*
  * BG_USB5000_IPS_TYPE_*
  * BG_USB5000_EXTOUT_*
  * BG_USB5000_MATCH_PACKET_*
  * BG_USB5000_MATCH_CRC_*
  * BG_USB5000_MATCH_ERR_*
  * BG_USB5000_COMPLEX_MATCH_EVENT_*
  * BeagleUsb5000IPSType
  * BeagleUsb5000ExtoutMode
  * BeagleUsb5000DataProperties
  * BeagleUsb5000PacketType
  * BeagleUsb5000ErrorType
  * BeagleUsb5000DataMatchUnit
  * BeagleUsb5000TimerMatchUnit
  * BeagleUsb5000AsyncEventType
  * BeagleUsb5000AsyncEventMatchUnit
  * BeagleUsb5000ComplexMatchState
  * BeagleUsb5000Channel

- The state with which the trigger occurred is now shifted.  To
  correctly identify the state, first mask the event by
  BG_EVENT_USB_TRIGGER_STATE_MASK, and then shift right by
  BG_EVENT_USB_TRIGGER_STATE_SHIFT.
- The BeagleUsb5000Usb3DataMatchUnit now combines the "data_not" and
  "match_other_packets" fields into a single "match_modifier".
