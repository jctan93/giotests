                       Total Phase USB Drivers
                       -----------------------

Instructions
------------
Please refer to the detailed instructions in the Aardvark, Beagle,
Cheetah, or Komodo datasheets on how to install the respective USB
driver.


Linux
-----
For all products, the Linux driver is based on libusb and there is
no need to install any other drivers on the operating system.  For
information on access permissions, refer to the datasheets and the
hotplug or udev infrastructure under Linux.


Windows
-------
To install the appropriate USB communication driver under Windows,
use the Total Phase USB Driver Installer before plugging in any
device. The driver installer can be found either on the CD-ROM
(refer to the HTML based guide) or in the Downloads section of the
Beagle analyzer product page on the Total Phase website.


Mac OS X
--------
The Beagle communications layer under Mac OS X does not require a
specific kernel driver to operate.  Both Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and 10.5
Leopard are supported.  It is typically necessary to ensure that the
user running the software is currently logged into the desktop.  No
further user configuration should be necessary.
