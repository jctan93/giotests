<h4>I2C Read Command</h4>

<p align=right><a href="help.html"><img src="back-icon.png" width="15" height="15" border="0"></a>

<pre>
&lt;i2c_read addr="<i>addr</i>" 
          count="<i>count</i>"
          nostop="<i>nostop</i>" 
          ten_bit_addr="<i>ten_bit_addr</i>"
          combined_fmt="<i>combined_fmt</i>"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>Read a stream of bytes from the I2C slave device.

<p><b>Parameters</b>

<dl>
    <dt><b>addr</b></dt>
    <dd>The slave from which to read.  The slave address can be
specified in decimal or hexadecimal notation.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>count</b></dt>
    <dd>The number of bytes to write (maximum 65535).
    </dd>
    <dt><b>nostop</b></dt>
    <dd>Request that no stop condition is issued on the I2C bus
after the transaction completes.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>ten_bit_addr</b></dt>
    <dd>Request that the provided address is treated as a 10-bit
address.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>combined_fmt</b></dt>
    <dd>Request that the Philips combined format is followed during
a I2C read operation.  This only has an effect when used in
conjunction with 10-bit addressing.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Details</b>

<p>For ordinary 7-bit addressing, the lower 7 bits of the addr
should correspond to the slave address. The topmost bits are
ignored. The Aardvark I2C subsystem will assemble the address along
with the R/W bit after grabbing the bus. For 10- bit addressing, the
lower 10 bits of addr should correspond to the slave address. The
Aardvark adapter will then assemble the address into the proper
format as described in the Philips specification, namely by first
issuing an write transaction on the bus to specify the 10-bit slave
and then a read transaction to read the requested number of bytes.
The initial write transaction can be skipped if the  Combined Format
feature is requested in conjunction with the 10-bit addressing
functionality.

<p>Please see the Aardvark I2C/SPI Embedded Systems Interface
Datasheet for more information.
